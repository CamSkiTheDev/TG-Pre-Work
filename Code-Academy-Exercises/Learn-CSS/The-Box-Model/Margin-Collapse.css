/* the margin to the left and righ add up and the sum is the space between those elements (div 1 - margin: 0 20px) (div 2 - margin: 0 20px) */

/* The total space between the elements would be 40px */

/* On the other hand the top and bottom margins collapse */

/* although the sum would be 50px the top and bottom margins collapse so the space between the two elements would be 30px */

var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = 'You can make carbonara with ' + pasta + ', ' + meat + ' and a sauce made with ' + sauce + '.';

//Learned that es6 fixed a lot of pitfalls of es5 and made it easier to read and easier for programers to learn.

<!-- In this leason I learned about HTML elements such as the paragraph tag -->
<!-- I also learned the each element is opened by brackets (<) followed by the type of element (p) the  followed by another bracket (>) -->
<!-- Then your content goes in side of the HTML element -->
<!-- Finally the HTML element is closed by a bracket followed by a forward slash (</) then the element you want to close (p) ended by a bracket (>) -->
